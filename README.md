Description
-----------

Functions must be used to perform the analysis described below. All output is to be written to an output file.

* Display Standard Header

Put your standard output information in a function named ShowHeader(). You will need to pass a file pointer.

* Read and store data

Read a column of data from an external file. The file name must be entered by the user. The exact number of points
is not known. There will be no more than 100 points in each datafile.

* Find the minimum, maximum, and average

A function for each operation should be written or a function that passes these values by reference may be used
(this is the preferred method).

* Calculate the standard deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. [Wikpedia link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)
